# Motivation and goal
This framework provides infrastructure which can be useful for creating minigames for Minecraft servers.
I started working on this project with the goal of making a set of tools that will allow minigame developers to solely focus on the logic that is specific to the game they are developing.
But in the end it is still a bit of a hobby project for me to see what sort of considerations come to light when developing infrastructure like this.

# Learn how it works
You can check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/mndg1/game-framework/wiki) for some guides on the framework's design and features.
